# Hypothesis_Testing_Using_Python
Hypothesis testing is a critical aspect of statistical inference that allows us to make informed decisions based on data. Itâ€™s a method used to test an assumption regarding a population parameter.

Introduction to Hypothesis Testing: Understand the basics and importance of hypothesis testing.
Formulating Hypotheses: Learn how to state the null and alternative hypotheses.
Choosing the Right Test: Identify the appropriate statistical test (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).
Data Preparation: Clean and prepare your data for analysis.
Conducting the Test: Implement the chosen test using Python libraries.
Interpreting Results: Understand and interpret the p-value and test statistics.
Drawing Conclusions: Make informed decisions based on the test results.
Real-World Examples: Apply hypothesis testing to practical scenarios.
Interactive Visualizations: Use visual tools to better understand the data and results.
